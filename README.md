# LogicValidator
This is an android app that checks the validity of the logic argument given.
## How to Use
Enter propositions and logic operators into the premises and conclusion via keyboard.
Simple propositions in your argument must be simplified to single character variables (e.g. p).
An Upper-case character (P) represents the same proposition as its lower-case character (p). Separate each premise by a comma.
The conclusion may only contain one Compound proposition.
## Logic Operators
- Negation Operator: ! or ~
- Conjuction Operator: &&
- Disjunction Operator: ||
- Conditional Operator: ] or >
- Biconditional Operator: ==
